On Monday, February 7th I started working at HeroDevs as a Senior Angular
Engineer! I'm incredibly excited for this role. It combines my passion for
Angular development with the chance to work with some world-class
developers and clients.

This blog post is a (i) short introduction to what I'll be working on at
HeroDevs and (ii) a one-person retrospective on my time at Ubiquisoft.

## 1. The Road Ahead: HeroDevs and Angular

[HeroDevs](https://herodevs.com) specializes in Angular development.
Our work includes AngularJS/Angular Migrations, Angular consulting, and
training. I expect the bulk of my time over the next year will be focused on
helping clients with these types of projects.

One of my co-workers describes our job as Angular "firefighters": we come in,
help set Angular issues straight, and go home. I have a lot of firefighters in
my extended family so I found this metaphor endearing.

I'm also interested in attending [ng-conf 2022](https://2022.ng-conf.org/) and
contributing to HeroDev's Open Source Software projects [Scull](https://scully.io/).

Mentorship and creating safe spaces are also core values to HeroDevs. In the
year ahead I want to take concrete steps to give back to the tech community.
I've taken a bit of a step back since COVID started and since I've had two
children under two, but this year I want to get more involved.

## 2. Reflections on my time at Ubiquisoft

I worked at Ubiquisoft as a frontend developer for two and a half years. COVID
has messed up my sense of time so it feels both longer and shorter than that.

I learned so much at Ubiquisoft and will always be grateful for the time I spent
there. It was a fantastic place to work on enterprise AngularJS/Angular
applications.

Here are a few notes about what I learned:

### Managing Complexity

One of the most challenging parts about working on enterprise applications is
dealing with complexity. For me, managing complexity means getting the
architecture right _and_ simplifying "user stories" into clear requirements.

At Flatiron, I got a high level view of the frontend and backend parts of the
web stack. At Ubiquisoft, I saw that even after you (1) learn _how_ to implement
a feature in part of the software stack, you still need to (2) understand
_what_ value your feature is actually adding.

Both (1) and (2) involve different types of complexity. As an attorney I think
I focused too much on the first type of complexity (technical/implementation).
At Ubiquisoft, I worked hard to build my technical skills while also striving
to ensure that my features actually added value to the client.

### Deployments and Agile Development

The third principle in [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is:

> Deliver working software frequently, from a
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
> preference to the shorter timescale.

I think this principle directly relates to the previous section of this blog
post (Managing Complexity). At Ubiquisoft, I saw that a feature's complexity
went hand-in-hand with its deployment schedule.

Of course, some project are actually complex (building a scheduling tool that
can handle timezone conversions) and take more than a week to complete. However,
that's an even bigger reason to break the project up into manageable features
and deploy them frequently.

## What Else is New?

It's been a while since my last blog post. Here's a snapshot of what I've been
up to over the last few months besides getting a new job:

- ðŸ”¨ Finished home renovation, added home office;
- ðŸ‘¶ Cheered on my ninth-month old son as he start to crawl and pull up;
- ðŸ“˜ Be amazed at my 2 year old's continued speech development, empathy, and spirit.
